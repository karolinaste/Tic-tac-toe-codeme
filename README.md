# Tic-tac-toe-codeme
Game created for the course at CODE:ME foundation


It was my first time creating a project from scratch to help bring an idea to life in ReactJS.

I am currently completing a course at CODE:ME JavaScript + React for beginners. 

There were two projects to choose from on the course to create and one free project. At first I chose the Millionaires quiz project, but until the last days I was not able to complete it - not having enough knowledge at the moment.

That's why last week I took the plunge and created a game that at my current level I am able to write (with the help of the internet) and understand every line written. 

I have chosen the game project "Tic tac toe".

First of all, in order to understand the basic operation of the game, I studied the materials available on the Internet, created simple graphics and took several hours to write code in JS (in which I have never worked before).

This repository shows how I managed to write a working game in JavaScript.
