# Tic-tac-toe-codeme
Game created for the course at CODE:ME foundation


I first created a project from scratch to help bring an idea to life in ReactJS.

I am currently completing a course at CODE:ME JavaScript + React for beginners. 

There were two projects to choose from in the course to create and one arbitrary project. At first I chose the Millionaires quiz project, but until the last days I was not able to finish it - not having enough knowledge at the moment.

Therefore, in the last week I have taken a life of my own and I am creating a game that at my current level I am able to write (with the help of the internet) and I understand every line written. 

I have chosen the "Tic tac toe" game project.

First, in order to understand its basic operation, I studied the materials available on the Internet, created simple graphics, and took several hours to write code in JS (in which I have never worked before).

This repository shows how I managed to write a working game in JavaScript.
